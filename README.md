# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Rock, Paper, Scissors (sometimes called roshambo) has been a staple to settle playground disagreements or determine who gets to ride in the front seat on a road trip. The game is simple, with a balance of power. There are three options to choose from, each winning or losing to the other two. In a series of truly random games, each player would win, lose, and draw roughly one-third of games. But people are not truly random, which provides a fun opportunity for AI.
